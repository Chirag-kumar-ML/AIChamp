I was very much indulge about the project we Ihave undertaken and I wanted to learn more about the various techniqueswhich included Generative Adverserial Nets. Even though I wasn't able tocrack the technique behind it, I was able to solve the problem with other ML  Page 2 of 4   techniques like Fourier transforms for trend analysis, ARIMA time seriesanalysis, Heteroskedasticity, multicollinearity, serial correlation, XGBoost andLSTM. I even used PCA to look at the patterns under the hood. This project was very inspiring to me and it even showed what we cando through ML to understand and interpret the data as well to build arecommendation system for them.
